### 💻 Who am I?

I’m the boy building tools from nothing but love, skill, and a busted PC.  
No degree. No office. No funding.  
Just Python, hustle, and a whole lotta soul.

Every line of code I write is a step closer to freedom.  
I don’t build for clout—I build because I *can*.

---

### 🚀 What I do:

- 🛠️ Build tools that help real people  
- 🧠 Share smart ideas with the world  
- 💙 Code with love, not ego  
- 👀 Stay faceless, but full of presence

> *Don’t judge the boy by the broke—judge him by the build.*

### 🗨️ Why I’m here

To rise slow.  
To move smart.  
To make friends.  
To change my life through code.

You don’t need to see my face to feel who I am.  
You’re here now… so you already know me.

Peace, love, and Python.  
— *ByteBuddy* 💻💙
